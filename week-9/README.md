## Description
As I discussed during the prototype questions session, I wanted my next controller iteration to be a wearable controller to simulate the act of playing "air guitar".

Maybe not quite as enthusiastically as that guy.

I started with a winter glove I already had and the twisted wires I salvaged from Prof. Dominic's collection. I hand-stitched the wires to the glove (making sure not to sew the glove shut by filling it with stationery), with one wire for each finger (each "button") and a wire connecting to the palm for the ground connection.

The ideal contacts would flex with the fabric of the glove, so using the materials generously provided by Prof. Dominic, I loosely stitched a large piece of conductive fabric to the glove's palm, and smaller squares to the tops of each finger. I decided where to sew these contacts after "play testing" the game with just a glove. I marked the areas where my fingers touched my palm, and after doing the same with a couple of friends, marked out an average area of contact for each finger and the palm. The placements aren't perfect, but by testing each "finger-down" connection with a multimeter, I was reasonably satisfied to move forward.

I then added a potentiometer to the cardboard of the "guitar" to test out the functionality of a dial-like add-on to mimic a tremolo arm (or "whammy bar").
