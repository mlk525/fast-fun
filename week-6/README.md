## Description
I wanted to improve my guitar controller, and I had the idea to switch from aluminum contacts to actual buttons.

After attaching the buttons to my first prototype, I made makeshift covers and glue-gunned them onto the buttons.

I then added a potentiometer to the cardboard of the "guitar" to test out the functionality of a dial-like add-on to mimic a tremolo arm (or "whammy bar").

By threading the wires for the buttons through the holes I had made earlier, I was able to wire everything up to the Arduino on the reverse side of the cardboard.

## Challenges/Discoveries
* I am going to try to work on my projects in the ITP shop or the Tandon MakerSpace, considering the limited resources I have available when working exclusively at home. The buttons were very difficult to wire with tape and a glue gun, and even attaching the makeshift covers to the buttons proved way harder than it should have. Having access to a soldering iron and a wider selection of adhesives would have made a huge difference.
* While I like the feel of the buttons compared to the contacts, I worry that the sound will be too distracting for a rhythm game. The whammy bar test seems successful, and I plan on factoring it into my future plans for this controller.
