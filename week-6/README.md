## Description
I wanted to improve my guitar controller, and I had the idea to switch from aluminum contacts to actual buttons.

After attaching the buttons to my first prototype, I made makeshift covers and glue-gunned them onto the buttons.

I then added a potentiometer to the cardboard of the "guitar" to test out the functionality of a dial-like add-on to mimic a tremolo arm (or "whammy bar").

By threading the wires for the buttons through the holes I had made earlier, I was able to wire everything up to the Arduino on the reverse side of the cardboard.
