# Week 7: Prototype Question

## Description
Going over the [list of prototype testing questions](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/prototype-testing-questions), I realized that a couple of the questions that stood out to me had a common idea at their core: 
### Are users excited about using the prototype?

I want to make sure that whatever I create, the answer to that question is always yes. Game controllers are the interface between the real world and the game world, and I've always felt that the game's job of entertaining you becomes much harder if how you interact with the game world isn't fun. I want future prototypes and iterations to focus on creating a novel, fun experience for the user. It's hard to pin down the qualities that make a controller "exciting", but here are some questions that could help (off the top of my head):
* Is the interface an original idea? (in my opinion, the originality of the game doesn't matter as much)
* If the prototype resembles anything that already exists, does it bring anything new to the idea?
* Is it easy to start using, but hard to master?
* Does it look cool to use? (literally what got me into Guitar Hero)
* Is the prototype in any way tiresome to use? Could you see yourself gaming with it for hours on end?

In hindsight, a lot of these questions would be suitable as prototype testing questions themselves, but in combination I think they could determine how much a user would look forward to using a controller. Thinking through these questions, along with the discussion on materials last class, led to me wondering if the next iteration of my guitar controller could be an "air" guitar. The idea of putting on gloves that register air guitar gestures as controller inputs definitely excites me, but I guess the point of user testing is to make sure that other people want to use what you want to build. I'm definitely excited to try making an air guitar controller. Another possibility I could continue exploring is the idea of shaping controllers like real world objects. Aside from the guitar hero controller, most controllers following that concept generally haven't seen much success, but I have to say, some of them are pretty exciting.
